    Enabling this will globally store the revision ids for the comment and use this to prevent commits being processed
    multiple times. This is useful if there is a job per branch. The commit ids processed will be stored in Jenkins, so
    if the jobs for each branch is on different Jenkins intances this will not work.

    This option has to be checked for all jobs were the same commit can be in the changelog, i.e. if there is a
    development job and a production job, then the option has to be checked for both.
